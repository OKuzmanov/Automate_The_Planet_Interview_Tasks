&ensp;d.   For every one of them save City name, State, ZipCode, Longitude and Latitude<br />
&ensp;e.   Generate a link to google maps by latitude and longitude for every one of the 10 results<br />

&ensp;g.   Save each screenshot on the disk with file name <CityName>-<State>-<ZipCode>.jpg, for example Paauilo- Hawaii- 96776.jpg<br />
